      <description>About I&amp;rsquo;m a product nerd and I love getting rejected.
Yes, you read it right.
It all started with a team of 3 misfits who share a common love for science, research and writing. We teamed up to compete in a national science competition even though&amp;hellip;
 no one we knew worked in the tech space we had zero funding where we come from, women aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to take electronics or drafting classes, only cosmetology and baking  Clearly, the odds were stacked against us.</description>
