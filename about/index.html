<p>Yes, you read it right.</p>
<p>It all started with a team of 3 misfits who share a common love for science, research and writing. We teamed up to compete in a national science competition even though&hellip;</p>
<ol>
<li>no one we knew worked in the tech space</li>
<li>we had zero funding</li>
<li>where we come from, women aren&rsquo;t allowed to take electronics or drafting classes, only cosmetology and baking</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, the odds were stacked against us.</p>
<p>Day 1, we met at a park. Brought out an empty notebook. On the first page, we wrote and signed our names on the THREE WORDS that would change my life FOREVER</p>
<p><strong>No matter what</strong></p>
<p>All the other competitors were from science high schools, taking specialized science / tech / engineering / research courses, with a network of connections in the academe / tech space&hellip; we had none of these</p>
<p><strong>No matter what</strong></p>
<p>They have relatively huge funding allocated to research&hellip; we had none</p>
<p><strong>No matter what</strong></p>
<p>They took classes on how to solder, design a circuit diagram, program a microcontroller&hellip; so far, we spent a year learning to paint our classmates' fingernails</p>
<p><strong>No matter what</strong></p>

<p>Many many years later, the things I&rsquo;ve learned throughout our journey have shaped the way I approach everything in my career and in life:</p>
<h2 id="everything-as-in-everything-is-figure-outable">everything, as in EVERYTHING, is figure-outable</h2>
<ol>
<li>Whether it&rsquo;s a skill or a topic that you need to know, the best way to get over that learning curve is to get your hands dirty and <a href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/what-actually-hello-world-means/146699/13" title="Title">&ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;</a> your way to an MVP aka a working product</li>
<li>don&rsquo;t get stuck in tutorial hell, instead, build projects that people will find useful then release it in public to get feedback</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m not saying it will be easy. it would probably be challenging, sometimes you&rsquo;ll get frustrated, there would be a lot of failure, but that&rsquo;s okay. You&rsquo;re in good company. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/sunniegiles/2018/04/30/how-to-fail-faster-and-why-you-should/?sh=73e8e946c177" title="Title">Fail fast</a> to learn fast.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="if-youre-really-really-stuck-reach-out-to-people-who-are-good-at-it---just-dont-forget-to-bring-coffee-and-cake">if you&rsquo;re really really stuck, reach out to people who are good at it - just don&rsquo;t forget to bring coffee and cake</h2>
<ol>
<li>You have nothing to lose. Reach out to that person. Maybe offer them something in return for lending you their time, something like&hellip;. free coffee and cake.</li>
<li>In my experience, this almost always blossoms into a wonderful thing. Best case scenario: we become best friends forever, we now live together and we&rsquo;re raising 40 chickens in Maragondon. Worst case scenario: they don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about and now you&rsquo;re eating this tasty AF cake by yourself</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="if-you-feel-like-quitting-rest-breathe-see-page-1-of-the-notebook">if you feel like quitting, rest, breathe, see page 1 of the notebook</h2>
<p>Since then, I have been building products and working with great people &amp; organizations rethinking the <a href="https://titaofdata.github.io/projects/">Future of X</a>.</p>
<p>If you are one of the</p>

<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2hZTpZrrDbY" title="Title">crazy ones</a></li>
<li>round pegs in the square holes</li>

<p>Outside of work,</p>
<ul>
<li>I build <a href="https://titaofdata.medium.com/15-ways-a-data-scientist-spent-the-quarantine-at-home-436fe4c16df4?source=friends_link&sk=20d7111141620a24239a3722d9180928">wooden furniture</a> by screaming while pressing the trigger on the circular saw</li>
<li>raise 40 native chickens (and counting), 3 doggos (Whitey, Dutch and Cookie) and 2 cats (Atty and Bonnie)</li>
<li>grow different herbs and vegetables hydroponically with a NFT system we custom built and iterate on regularly</li>
<li>play rhythm guitar in a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/faithline-inertia" title="Title">band & currently playing bass</a></li>
<li>perform <a href="https://honestdeceiver.com/" title="Title">card flourishes</a> to tell a story</li>
<li>you can ask me about startups, AI (and data ethics), abnormal psychology (my mom and dad were both AB psych college professors so my early memory as a child is spending my afternoons reading the big book of ab psych we have at home) and Law (I have a list of the best legal novels and movies that I think everyone should read / watch)</li>

<p>&hellip; if you are an expert on any of the above, let&rsquo;s make stuff - coffee&rsquo;s on me.</p>
        <p>2021 Recap: I worked with a multi-million dollar B2B / B2C e-commerce company located in Los Angeles, California. My role involved setting up the company's data infrastructure and bringing analytics & decision science into the business. As a huge fan of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAHoQdlxH28">The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_DragCon_LA">RuPaul's Drag Race</a>, it still blows my mind that I get to work as a Pinay Data Scientist in an LA-based retail company.</p>
    
        <p>2022 Update: I'm currently working with a London-based tech company as a Product Manager, getting paid to build the future of X, day in and day out.</p>
